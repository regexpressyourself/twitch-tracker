## Introduction

I've been streaming on Twitch, and decided to take their viewer API and write a viewer monitoring application with a simple, clean UI.

## Getting Started

The server itself is fairly straight forward Node and Express stuff, detailed below.

### Prerequisites


Make sure you have Node and NPM installed. [You can download Node here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). This will install NPM as well.

You are welcome to use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) instead of NPM if you prefer.

### Installing

First, clone the project to a local directory.

```
   git clone https://github.com/regexpressyourself/twitch-tracker.git && cd twitch-tracker
```

Next, install the dependencies using NPM or Yarn.

#### Using NPM

```
   npm install
```

#### Using Yarn

```
   yarn install
```

## Deployment


#### Using NPM

```
   npm run start
```

#### Using Yarn

```
   yarn run start
```

   That's it! Your development server is running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Built With

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Can't express how excited I am to have Node on this server finally
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - I have an unabashed exclusive relationship with Express routing
* [Steam Shovel](https://www.facebook.com/SteamShovelCoffee/) - Couldn't have done it without it
